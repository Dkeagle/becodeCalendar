# becodeCalendar
Using the Google Calendar API, this website gathers the 30 incoming events from a Google calendar and displays them on it's main page with a "better" UI/UX.
It was made for (and only for) my training in BeCode Belgium, as our planning was posted on Google Calendar, and not everyone is using Google Services.
